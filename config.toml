<h3>Company</h3> <br> \
In 2013, I founded the company [XForge Software Development](//xforge.at). We build complete, native mobile solutions for our customers. Being in a small, three-person team, I learned a lot about working very efficiently - and not being afraid to jump into a project head first. <br> \
<br> \
<h3>Fastlane</h3> <br> \
I am one of the core contributors of the popular [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) project. Fastlane is used by thousands of developers all over the world and helped save countless wasted developer hours. <br>\
<br> \
<h3>‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source</h3> <br> \
This page, all of it's contents, the scripts used to create the whole setup on AWS and the deployment scripts are all [available on GitHub](https://github.com/milch/supermil.ch). <br>\
<br> \
<h3>Recruiters</h3> <br> \
