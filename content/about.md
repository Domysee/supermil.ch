### Company
In 2013, I founded the company [XForge Software Development](//xforge.at). We built complete, native mobile solutions for our customers. Being in a small, three-person team, I learned a lot about working very efficiently - and not being afraid of taking ownership of new projects.


### Fastlane 
I am one of the core contributors of the popular [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) project. fastlane is used by thousands of developers all over the world and helped save countless developer hours. 


### Open Source
This page, all of it's contents, the scripts used to create the whole setup on AWS and the deployment scripts are all [available on GitHub](https://github.com/milch/supermil.ch).
