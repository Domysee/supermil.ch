### Company
In 2013, I founded the company [XForge Software Development](//xforge.at). We built complete, native mobile solutions for our customers. Being in a small, three-person team, I learned a lot about working very efficiently - and not being afraid of taking ownership of new projects. I have since left the company in January 2017.
